        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra </em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was <em> a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10</em>.<br>
        And <em><strong>Shakespeare</strong></em> had to learn <em>his ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
       <em> Until one day, you walk.</em><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each <em>wrong answer</em> making your brain a little bit <em>stronger</em>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And <strong>you keep going</strong>.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        <em>Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.</em><br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em><strong>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</strong></em>
